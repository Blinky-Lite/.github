# Blinky-Lite
**Blinky-Lite**  is a full-stack, integrated hardware-software control platform based on Edge computing technology designed by hardware engineers that can perform at any scale from home automation to particle accelerators.

**Blinky-Lite** was developed at the MaxIV Synchrotron Light Source and the European Spallation Source both located in Lund, Sweden. In the world of complex and costly particle accelerators, ***a strong 24/7 maintenance mindset is a must***. It is essential to always understand the state of a machine remotely and to be able to securely troubleshoot it efficiently from anywhere in the world at any time.  

**Thatâ€™s why we developed Blinky-Lite**

# Features
- ## Mobility
  Most other control platforms sit behind a firewall and remote access is an afterthought Not with **Blinky-Lite**. Secure remote access was the paramount requirement from the start. All **Blinky-Lite** applications are web apps that can be securely accessed from anywhere in the world. Web apps require no installation and the user is always guaranteed to get the latest version. 
- ## Security
  **Blinky-Lite** connections are always initiated from within the user's facility,not from the outside, providing secure information flow from you to the machine/sensor and back. All **Blinky-Lite** mobile apps require two factor authentication, ensuring that only the right people have access.
- ## Flexibility
  **Blinky-Lite** can be added independently or on top of any existing control system
- ## Open source
  Every single line of the **Blinky-Lite** codebase is version-controlled and open allowing  **Blinky-Lite** to grow with the user's facility.
    - No license fees
    - No proprietary software  
- ## Services
  Most other control platforms only offer a communication protocol, but **Blinky-Lite** out of the box provides:
  - Alarm Scanning
  - SMS Alarm messaging
  - Data Logging
  - Access Logging
  - Settings Logging
  - Application role based access
  - Data stream role based access
  - Zero-code application builder
